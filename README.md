# Mailbox Management System

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a Mailbox Management System that allows for the creation, updating, retrieval, and deletion (CRUD) of mailboxes programmatically. The application will enable users to manage mailboxes efficiently through a web interface, leveraging various modern technologies.

## Features

- **Mailbox Creation**: Programmatically create new mailboxes.
- **Mailbox Management**: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing mailboxes.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A responsive and intuitive web interface for managing mailboxes.

## Technologies Used

- **C#**: Backend development and business logic implementation.
- **Azure Graph API**: For interacting with Microsoft 365 services, including mailbox management.
- **OData**: For querying and interacting with the data.
- **Angular**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **HTML & CSS**: For structuring and styling the web pages.
- **MSSQL**: Database management system for storing mailbox-related data.

## Planned Architecture

1. **Frontend**:
   - **Angular**: The UI will be developed using Angular, offering a dynamic and responsive user experience.
   - **HTML/CSS**: Standard web technologies will be used for markup and styling.

2. **Backend**:
   - **C#**: The backend will be written in C#, handling the business logic and interactions with external services.
   - **Azure Graph API**: This will be utilized to interact with Microsoft 365 services, particularly for mailbox management.
   - **OData**: OData will be used to simplify data interactions between the client and the server.
   - **MSSQL**: The database will store all relevant information, including user data and mailbox configurations.

3. **Database**:
   - **MSSQL**: The application will use MSSQL for persistent data storage.

## Progress and Next Steps

- **Research**: Currently researching the best practices for integrating Azure Graph API with C# for mailbox management.
- **Setup**: Setting up the initial project structure and preparing the development environment.
- **Development**: Development will begin with the backend API and database design, followed by frontend implementation.
